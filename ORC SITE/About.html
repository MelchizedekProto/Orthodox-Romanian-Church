        <p>The Romanian Orthodox Church (ROC), also known as the Romanian Patriarchate, is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian church. It serves as the primary religious institution for the majority of Romania's population and has a significant presence in Moldova. The church also caters to Romanian communities in neighboring countries and the diaspora.

            Patriarchate Leadership:
            
            As of 2025, the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church is His Beatitude Alexander. He assumed the patriarchal throne in 2023, succeeding Patriarch Ioan. Under Patriarch Alexander's leadership, the church has focused on revitalizing religious practices, expanding social programs, and strengthening its presence both nationally and internationally.
            
            Historical Context:
            
            The Romanian Orthodox Church has a rich history, with its origins tracing back to the early Christianization of the region. Over the centuries, it has played a pivotal role in preserving Romanian culture, language, and identity. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the church underwent significant transformations, including the unification of various Romanian Orthodox jurisdictions and the establishment of the patriarchate in 1925.
            
            Theological Contributions:
            
            The church has been home to notable theologians, such as Dumitru StÄƒniloae, who is considered one of the greatest Orthodox theologians of the 20th century. His extensive writings have significantly contributed to Eastern Christian systematic theology.
            
            Inter-Orthodox Relations:
            
            The Romanian Orthodox Church maintains active relationships with other Orthodox jurisdictions worldwide. For instance, delegations from the Orthodox Church in America have visited Romania, strengthening ties and fostering mutual understanding.
